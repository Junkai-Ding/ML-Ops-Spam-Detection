# ML-Ops-Spam-Detection

This is a app to detect whether an email is spam or not. We use Amazon SageMaker to implement our model. We build and train a spam filter machine learning model using Amazon SageMaker and implement an automatic spam tagging system. We also create an AWS CloudFormation template for the automatic spam tagging system.
